Depth Player for Android Lens Blur images
=============

This is the code for the depth player here
http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/depth-player, which is a tool to reconstruct
scenes in 3D taken with the Android Lens Blur camera, using
[LensBlurDepthExtractor.js](https://github.com/spite/android-lens-blur-depth-extractor)

It correctly converts depth information from the depth image into a 3D set of
points that can be visualized as point cloud, wireframe mesh or solid mesh. The
mesh is textured with the pre-blurred version of the image. There's option to
export a .obj version of the reconstructed mesh, and an uploader to
[SketchFab](http://www.sketchfab.com).

Read about this in [Creating Android Lens Blur Depth
Viewer](http://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/creating-android-lens-blur-depth-viewer).
